Python-UnHasher---GUI
=====================
These are simply dictionary attacks, no brute forcing going on....

######  Hasher  ######
For the Hasher to work you need to supply a blank formated wordlist.txt (in the same directory as the program) 
The passwords(to be hashed) must be listed one per line. 
Each Time the program runs, it generates a new file to output the hashes to.
If you are using this a lot, you're gonna need ot move the generated files.

######  Unhasher & Unhasher GUI  ######
For the Unhasher to work, you need to supply both a blank formated wordlist.txt and a hashlist.txt
If you are getting errors, your file is either not named correctly, formatted correctly, or not in the same directory as the program.
